# Frontend Upgrade Plan: Migrating to shadcn/ui

## Scope
- **Replace all custom frontend components** in the portfolio project with shadcn/ui components.
- **Customize the theme** using shadcn/ui's theming capabilities to match the desired brand/style.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Preparation & Clarification
- Ensure the project uses React and Tailwind CSS (already present).
- Confirmed: All custom components will be replaced.
- Confirmed: Theme will be customized using shadcn/ui.

### 2. Install shadcn/ui
- Install shadcn/ui CLI and dependencies:
  - `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
- Configure the CLI to match the project structure (e.g., where to place components).

### 3. Component Audit
- List all current components to upgrade:
  - NavBar
  - About
  - ProjectSection
  - ProfileSection
- For each, identify the shadcn/ui base component(s) to use (e.g., Card, Button, Avatar, NavigationMenu).

### 4. Upgrade Process (Iterative per Component)
For each component:
  1. Backup the current implementation (optional, but recommended).
  2. Replace or refactor the component using shadcn/ui primitives.
  3. Customize styles and content as needed.
  4. Test for visual and functional correctness.
  5. Commit changes.

### 5. Global Styling & Theming
- Adjust Tailwind config if needed for shadcn/ui.
- Set up global theme (light/dark, brand colors, fonts) using shadcn/ui theming tools.
- Ensure consistency across all components.

### 6. Polish & QA
- Test responsiveness and accessibility.
- Check for visual consistency.
- Optimize for performance (tree-shaking, minimal imports).

### 7. Documentation & Handoff
- Document any customizations or overrides.
- Update README with usage notes for shadcn/ui.
